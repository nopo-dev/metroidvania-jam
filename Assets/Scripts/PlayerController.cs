public class PlayerController : MonoBehaviour
{
    /*
    player controller features
    start here:
    move left right (can move in air, partial movement?)
    jump (only when grounded, plan for double jump eventually?)

    later:
    attack (free, except when ccd in some way)
    heal (only when grounded? cant move? partial movement?)
    special (projectile vomit)
    other stuff eventually...

    think about how i want controlling the character to feel
    i guess relatively weighty/clunky
    dont think it really makes much sense for it to be like super nimble
    probably feel like it should have enough lag in animations
